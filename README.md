# DS-LPA
The Algorithm folder contains DS-LPA and the comparison algorithm involved in the paper.
In DS-LPA, the Karate data set is taken as an example. Users can write corresponding data reading methods according to the specific data format.
The Dataset folder contains the data set involved in the paper and the synthetic network generation program (LFR-benchmark).
The paper deals with three different formats of network data sets.
The data set of Type-One is a simple and strongly connected Graph.
The data set of Type-Two is the synthetic data set generated by LFR.
The data set of Type-One is the big data set p2p-Gnutella network.
Data sets with the COMM identity are common community partition.（Some data sets have it, and some don't.）
Please note that different types of data sets take different data reading methods.
LFR programs can be downloaded https://www.santofortunato.net/resources. The website also contains the principles and instructions of the LFR program.
